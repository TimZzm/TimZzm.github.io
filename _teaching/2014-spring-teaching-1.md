Description
======
In Fall 2024, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate Linear Algebra course at NYU. I was in charge of teaching 2 recitation sections every Friday, distribute weekly quizzez to my students, and collecting and grading the quizzez. I also made a [Final Review Note](../files/LA_final_revw.pdf) by myself, in which the contents are corresponding to [Interactive Linear Algebra](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/).
