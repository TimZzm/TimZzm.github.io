Hi, I am Zimu (Tim) Zhou, a first-year M.S. in Data Science student at NYU. I completed my undergraduate education at NYU, too, majored in Honors Mathematics. My research and work interests lie on machine learning and statistics, and I am seeking for Summer 2025 internship opportunities.

Currently, I am working with Professor [Olivier Pauluis]( https://wp.nyu.edu/opauluis/) on applied math research on Moist Rayleigh Benard Convection and Global Climate Data Analysis using the data from [WCRP]( https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) (World Climate Research Programme). I also had several internship experiences in Hong Kong and Mainland China. All of these experiences trained my skills in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

Besides academics, I enjoy playing frisbee, succor, and table tennis, and I am a fan of Real Marid. I also love DC comics and playing Tetris.

You can find my Resume [here](../assets/Resume_Newest.pdf).
