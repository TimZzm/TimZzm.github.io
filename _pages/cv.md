Internship experience
======
* Research Intern at [InsurTech NY](https://www.insurtechny.com/), New York, May- August 2025
  *	\[Insurance Data ETL & Analytics\]: Automated Python pipelines to process multi-line premium and loss data, calculating monthly premiums, reserves, incurred losses, and loss ratios. Produced stratified actuarial analyses by state, age cohort, loss quartile, and claim severity.
  * \[Risk Prediction Modeling\]: Built XGBoost regression models to predict incurred losses using applicant criminal history, supporting underwriting risk assessment and claim cost forecasting.



* Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [AutoNavi Software Co., Ltd](https://www.amap.com/), Beijing, June- August 2024
  *	\[Client Branch Store Sales Prediction\]: Employed XGBoost to build regression tree models to predict the sales of client’s new branch stores with 90% of predictions within ±20% of actual values.
  *	\[Branch Store Site Selection\]: Exploited DBSCAN clustering to extract key characteristics of high-volume stores and used cosine similarity to locate similar customer regions.
  *	\[Faculty/Students Classification\]: Utilized XGB multi-classification tree to differentiate among 2M+ faculties, students, and other people based on their daily routes, running on cloud computing platform.
  *	\[Branch Store Road Match\]: Developed a MySQL ETL script to match the client’s branch stores with nearby segmented roads from electronic map grids.
  *	\[Trade Area Determination\]: Built a SQL pipeline to determine the primary trade area of 150+ branch stores based on the matched surrounding roads, employing custom Python functions utility for calculations and data transformation.



* Data Scientist Intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/about.html), Hong Kong, July- August 2022
  *	\[Microloan Applicants Classification\]: Used classification tree model to classify microloan applicants into three risk categories based on previous credit history, enhancing the risk control framework.
  *	\[Actual Income Estimation\]: Developed a model for income estimation for microloan applicants by applying separate linear regressions to declared and TU-estimated income, taking the minimum to mitigate overstatement risks. This approach improved accuracy by 15% over the previous model.
  *	\[Automated Microloan Approval\]: Applied category-specified logistic regression to automate the microloan approval process, reducing high-risk approvals with accuracy 73%.



* Quantitative Researcher Intern at [AQUMON](https://www.aqumon.com/en/), Hong Kong, June- July 2022
  *	\[P&L calculator\]: Designed a P&L calculator to measure slippage and trading performance for managed futures (CTAs), supporting portfolio evaluation.
  *	\[Automated ETL\]: Built ETL pipelines to extract and reconcile client trading data from bank statements, reducing reconciliation errors and manual processing.
  *	\[Futures Optimization\]: Developed Python toolkits to automate futures contract roll decisions, optimizing replacement strategy to maximize returns based on price, order flow, and delivery timing.




Research Experience
======
* Climate Data Reconstructions (Research assistant at NYU Courant), New York, May 2025- Present
  * \[Model Development\]: Trained 30+ deep learning architectures (VAEs and U-Net variants) with diverse loss functions (RMSE, Wasserstein distance, Tweedie loss, weighted losses, and segmentation machine learning losses) to reconstruct 3D climate fields from 2D predictors.
  * \[Post Analysis\]: Assessed the models by KL-divergence, threshold-based accuracy metrics, contingency tables, confusion matrix, and distributional histograms, ensuring robust model evaluations.
  * \[Reliability & Uncertainty Analysis\]: Quantified model uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout and conducted specialized error analyses (e.g., boundary vs. interior error), identifying systematic weaknesses and improving interpretability.

* Applied Math Research: Moist Convection Simulations
  *	Developed 30+ Python scripts to simulate convection models derived from Navier-Stokes equations in 2D and 3D. Ran the simulations on HPC systems, varying resolutions, initial conditions, and boundary conditions.
  *	Applied PCA and Fourier Transform to detect key periodic features from high-dimensional time-series data generated by the simulation.
  *	Participated and presented progress report in the weekly Atmosphere Group Meeting and Dean’s
Undergraduate Research Conference ([DURF](https://cas.nyu.edu/undergraduate-research/undergraduate-research-conference.html)).
