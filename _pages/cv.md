Education
======
* M.S. in Data Science, New York University, 2026 (expected)
* B.A. in Mathematics with High Honors, New York University, 2024

Internship experience
======
* Summer 2024: Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Amap
  *	Employed XGBoost to build regression tree models to predict the sales of client’s new branch stores at universities and hospitals with an accuracy of 88% and 92%, respectively.
  *	Exploited the DBSCAN clustering model to identify the key features of high-volume stores and calculated the cosine similarities to identify areas with similar customer profiles.
  *	Utilized XGB multi-classification tree to differentiate among 10 million+ faculties, students, and other people in the universities with an accuracy of 86%.
  *	Developed a MySQL-based data pipeline to match the client’s branch stores with nearby segmented roads from electronic map grids.
  *	Built a SQL-based model to determine the primary trade area of 150+ branch stores, employing self-made custom Python functions utility for necessary distance calculation and data transformation


* Summer 2023: Data Scientist Intern at Tencent
  * Used decision tree model to classify loan applicants into three risk categories based on previous credit history, enhancing the risk control framework.
  * Developed a model for income estimation for small loan applicants by applying separate linear regressions on declared and TU-estimated income, taking the minimum to mitigate overstatement. Improved accuracy by 15% over the previous model.
  * Applied category-specified logistic regression to automate the loan approval process, improving loan decision efficiency and reducing high-risk approvals with accuracy 73%.



* Summer 2022: Quantitative Researcher Intern at AQUMON
  *	Developed a P&L calculator and evaluator program to calculate the client's slippage and trading P&L when purchasing CTAs.
  *	Designed an automated ETL script that extracts client’s trading data from daily bank statements to the company’s record, fixing all the previous incorrect data.
  *	Built a Python script to calculate and prioritize different holdings for inter-futures trading, optimizing trade execution and improving overall portfolio performance.


Research Experience
======
* Applied Math Research: Moist Convection Simulartions and Global Climate Data Analysis at NYU
  *	Developed 30+ Python scripts to simulate and analyze climate models on moist convections on High-Performance-Computing (HPC) in Linux environment, varying parameters and boundary conditions. 
  *	Applied PCA and Fourier Transform to extract key periodic features from high-dimensional time-series data generated by the simulation.
  *	Created detailed data visualizations to interpret simulation results and support comprehensive analysis and insights.
  * Extracted global climate change data from the NSF database and analyzed and visualized the data using
Xarray and Zarr.
  * Participated and presented progress report in the weekly Atmosphere Group Meeting and Dean’s
Undergraduate Research Conference ([DURF](https://cas.nyu.edu/undergraduate-research/undergraduate-research-conference.html)).


Skills
======
*	Programming: Python (np, pd, plt, XGBoost, Torch, Xarray), SQL, R, Julia
*	Machine Learning: XGB Trees, Random Forest, Neural Network, Score-Based Diffusion Model
*	Passed Actuarial Exams: SRM (Statistics for Risk Modelling), P (Probability)
