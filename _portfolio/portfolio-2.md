In this research project, I conducted various climate change trend analysis based on the [cmip6](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip6/) dataset. For example, by using the historical data of global surface temperature, co2 mass, and radiative forcing, I performed parameter estimation for the [climate feedback model](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/climate-change-and-climate-modeling/greenhouse-effect-and-climate-feedbacks/4E6803CFA666F749117F2D7F1F75A521) and the climate model developed by [Gregory et al.]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2003GL018747)

For the code I wrote, see [here](https://github.com/TimZzm/Graduate_research.git)
